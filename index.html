            <p>Hi there!!! I'm a freshman at <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/">York University</a>, where I have a chance to follow my passion in IT, get in touch to new technology, or knowledge that I never thought about.</p>
            <p>In York University, I'm currently enrolled in <a href="https://futurestudents.yorku.ca/program/information-technology">Information Technology</a> program, which is my most favorite program at all time, since I got a chance to get in touch with IT (which I passionate about) and together with Business (which is also top 1 of my favorite). Currently, I'm still a freshman and probably doesn't have any skills related to IT right now, but I promised to myself that I'll be master in IT, and start my own IT related business one day.üòÅ</p>

    <h2>Feeling hooked? Here's more about me: </h2>
    <p>Ok, now we get in the detail, personally, I think that I am a bit lazy ü§ê, unmotivated (sometimes only), and introverted. I tend to leave everything till the deadline yet start doing it, feelling want to change my self (be an expert at something) then laid on bed and dreaming, and feels like I need networking but my introvert self say: "Nope, I'm to shy for that".</p>
    <p>However, among those bad (extremely bad I mean), I still have a good side tho... I tend to think that I'm a good guy.. I "probably" do a lot of good things, and thinking for the others ( I don't know how to explain to you but wait till you be my friends then, or ar least meet me in person üëãüèº ). Uhh, I think I talk too much, and I haven't tell you about my age, or full name or sum, lol.</p>
    <p>So yea. My full name is <span class="highlight">Viet Hoang Thanh Dinh</span>, I'm <span class="highlight">2005 (19 years old)</span>, and I originally born in <span class="highlight">VietNam</span>, but I moved here to study High School program since 14. And now I'm here, introduce myself to you !!</p>
    
    <h2>My Learning Plan</h2>
    <p>My step 1 is that after I finish this semester, I'll start my Summer challenge by start study some courses on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>, and create some project, and then get my profile ready to apply for an Internship. Yayyy! And btw, I'm actually listed some of the courses that I want to take already, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/home/my-courses/wishlist/">Here it is!!!</a>, feel free to purchase that for me üòç</p>
